To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as \"Hunters.\" Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the \"World's Weakest,\" owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills. \n\nHowever, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo\u2014believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong\u2014awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This \"Quest Log\" demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest's rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world's most fearsome Hunters. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He meets the good, the bad, and everyone in between, and allows them to reflect on their lives. Some require comfort, while others repent or regret their actions. God provides a fair judgment to all before they can pass on to the other side.\n\nLife waits for no one. Still, people take living for granted while they are still in this world. But all men must die when their time comes. Philosophical and thought-provoking, About Death looks into concepts of life and death through the various experiences of dying people and their individual encounters with God.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A tenacious villainess extra, who always comes back to haunt the male lead in every way but cannot be abandoned because she is his teacher's daughter.\n\nThroughout reading the novel, I cursed at that daughter.

Inevitably, I ran away, but... I died. However, when I opened my eyes, Father was alive?! 'If so, in this life, I will definitely save Father!' However...\n\n\"To think they're aiming at my granddaughter!? I'll kill them all!\" Why do I see Grandfather, who doesn't even appear many times throughout the novel, so often like this? \"Marriage? No. Yeonie said that she would live by my side for the rest of her life.\" Even Father, somehow became weird. Moreover... \"Why do you keep avoiding me? Is this also my mistake?\" Isn't the main character suddenly becoming obsessed with me? \"Originally, I was destined to die.

I don't think I'm trash.\" The villain who blew off my neck is suddenly trying to repent.\n\nIs it really okay if it's like this?\n\n(Source: Yeondam, translated)",

Lapis is one such prospective soldier, yet she has failed the exam time and again, unable to muster even a spark of divine power. The reason for this is that she is, in truth, a magician\u2014one who bears the legacy of the Dark Lord, doomed to fall into madness and turn into a dark beast. Lapis holds out hope that she can stave off her fate by becoming a holy knight.\n\nAfter accidentally summoning the Dark Lord back into existence, Lapis learns that even Calla is no longer able to prevent the creation of magicians; her death and subsequent curse have warped into something she cannot control. Calla promises to break the curse of magicians if Lapis retrieves the shattered remains of her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Will humans just sit back and see their land get destroyed? They are too devious for that... Their only good plan at that point is to abduct a \"Dragon\" to even things up. But how are they going to manage the capture of a being with so much power? \n\n(Source: Easy Going Scans)",

While Iju, reduced to living as a housewife with abusive in-laws, tolerated it all for her husband's sake. All that mattered was that they were together.\n\nHowever, when Iju discovers that Sehyeok is actually in love with her universally beloved sister Yura, things take a tragic turn. Fleeing the scene of her husband's confession in shock, Iju is fatally struck by a car, and the last thing she sees is Sehyeok covering Yura's eyes instead of rushing to her side.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Iju opens her eyes to find herself transported exactly one year into her past, just before her marriage to Sehyeok. This unexpected second chance is also an opportunity to exact revenge on all those who brought her to ruin the first time. So this time, Iju plans to play the game the way that everyone else does\u2014and win.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Then one day, seemingly out of the blue, Moolchi's absentee father sends him a most unusual gift\u2014a stunningly-proportioned \"girl\" who may or may not be made of flesh and blood. She calls herself \"Six\" and mumbles incoherently about having a prime directive. This strange and exquisite creature quickly turns the boy's life upside-down, violently disposing of junior-high hooligans and anybody else who gets in his or her way, all while wearing a getup that would make Barbarella blush. In the midst of these baffling occurrences, Moolchi just can't seem to stop worrying about his German homework. The word \"oblivious\" barely does him justice as Moolchi remains blissfully unaware of his father's dangerous double-life, or the cute hall monitor who harbors a crush on him, or the intentions of this mysterious femme fatale who insists on bathing with him. Meanwhile, ominous storm clouds gather on the horizon, and one lingering question looms above the others...who is this so-called \"Zero\" that everybody is looking for?\n\n(Source: NetComics)",

The widow rents a room in her house to a man, but soon after, the man and the widow have feelings for each other. The key thing here is that the story is told through the eyes of the six year-old child.\nIn this parody, the widow is a \"game-junkie\" who runs a game room. One day a very handsome man collapses in the game room. \n\n(Source: MegKF)",

Forces are being deployed, and secret alliances are being made. Meanwhile, urban violence explodes onto the streets of Tokyo, and Hae-sung, the leader of a Korean-Japanese teenage mob, gets caught on camera by an NHK reporter as he murders a Yakuza boss.\n\nPolitical tensions reach boiling point as the exposure of Korean concentration camps in Indonesia leads Korea to enter the war. Alliances between neighboring countries are forged as the world readies itself for a massive clash. In the midst of the chaos, Hae-sung must hide from the police and the Yakuza, both of whom want to find and execute him.\n\nThe ramifications of Korea's war against Japan are felt closer to home as Korean citizens living in Japan are branded as \"outsiders.\" The tragedy of Auschwitz repeats itself as these people are forced to wear identifying armbands, are ostracized by the Japanese populace and forced into Korean ghettos. The segregation takes a turn for the worse as Koreans are herded onto trains and sent to war camps. All the while, Korean and Japanese armed forces wage all-out war against each other on land, sea and air.\n\nThe lucky ones, like Yusung and Uhmji, lose their jobs but are allowed to return home to the Oh family residence. With the fugitive Hae-Sung now in police custody, the Yakuza look to his family for revenge.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Both are established career women, and though they approach dating from the opposite ends of the spectrum, their goal is the same: Find that special connection. The flighty but sweet-hearted Aeri is focused on finding a hot piece to give her some much-needed TLC, but she can't seem to attract an acceptable potential partner without resorting to...dare we say it? A blind date! Her sexy roommate Nagyung, on the other hand, can't seem to fend off a constant stream of playboy pursuers. Too bad they all seem more interested in her good looks than who she is as a person\u2014so not what she is looking for!\n\nWatch and laugh with the single ladies of Please, Please Me as they commiserate over botched blind-dates, wannabe-pimp playas, and even a wardrobe malfunction or two!

All of Bermesiah  Continent was devastated; many heroes fell in battle, and even the Queen of Serdin sacrificed her life in hopes of ending the fighting.\n\nThe death of the Queen of Serdin broke Kaze'aze's hold over the Queen of Kanavan, who, after finally regaining her senses, erupted with fury over Kaze'aze's treachery. Kaze'aze escaped before the Queen of Kanavan could execute her. This lead the Queen to dispatch Trackers to punish the Queen of Darkness. But after years of searching, she was nowhere to be found and the Queen's Trackers vanished as well; forcing the Queen of Kanavan to abandon her search.\n\nThe Serdin Kingdom experienced a series of bizarre incidents related to Kaze'aze after the Five-Year War: these events revealed that Kaze'aze manipulated the Kanavan and Serdin Kingdoms into fighting each other. The newly appointed Queen of Serdin is now determined to prevent Kaze'aze from starting another war between the two kingdoms for the sake of the entire continent. The Queen of Serdin has prepared to confront Kaze'aze and counter her evil plans by organizing Grand Chase, an elite corps that will fight for all of Bermesiah. \n\n(Source: Grand Chase Wikia)",

When Star One's ever-hopeful members\u2014Soule, Eugene, Taho, Viken, and Avys\u2014fill a last-minute vacant spot at a tier one idols' show, they find themselves in the eye of the terrorists' attack. As the situation escalates, Soule unleashes his magical abilities for the first time and saves everyone.\n\nWith this miraculous turn of events, the boys are given another chance to excel in the idol industry; they are assigned a capable trainer specialized in awakening and controlling one's magical powers. However, the terrorists suspect Star One to be \"boys of destiny\" fated to save the world\u2014and swear on destroying them for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The world plunges into a development race to find uses of this new seemingly unlimited source of energy that cannot be seen or felt.\n\n16 years after the discovery, it's now the self-proclaimed Age of Magic, where you can download an App to your very phone and cast magic. However, heavy restrictions have been imposed over the available spells, and the required paperwork to even use a high level spell are astronomic.\n\nAmong the citizens of this new world, a red robed mysterious man seems capable of wielding extremely powerful magic in a way that should not be possible. It's unknown what his aim is or what he wants to accomplish. All that's known about this mysterious person is that he has been using forbidden level spells to kill evil-doers throughout the city.\n\nBut detective Kim is in charge of catching this murderer/hero. And he doesn't plan on giving up.\n\n(Source: MU)",

But, what should've been a cushy life in high society, soon turns into one life-threatening hassle after another. Pulled in every direction, she is forced to go on a quest to defeat the Demon King, forced to keep her heroic quest a secret, and forced to re-enroll at the academy she left behind years ago, making her a downright \"fossil\" compared to her peers. Still, anything is better than living with her cold-blooded sister, openly known to have killed her own brother and possibly their parents too.

Trapped under her murderous older sister's thumb and stuck between a sibling rivalry over the crown, Ashleigh can never seem to catch a break.

I thought my future would be bright but I didn't realize that the place I reincarnated into was a discontinued R-19 tragic BL novel that my friend wrote. And of all things, I became the older twin sister of Lisandro, the crazy obsessive yandere male lead who horribly, brutally murdered the sickly prisoner Frey at the end of the novel. Had I not remembered this, I would have just skipped into the sunset, blissfully unaware...\n\n\"Noona!\"\n\nWith a suitcase in one hand, I flinched and looked behind me. The mysteriously beautiful Frey came towards me with a bright smile on his lips. In no time, he towered over me with his tall, lean body.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Um.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\n'Don't ask.' I wanted to say that firmly, but I just wore a smile instead. Frey, who kept staring me, tried to grab my suitcase. Taken aback, I held onto it tightly. In return, I heard a refreshing, clear laugh.\n\n\"Let me hold it for you.\"\n\"No, I'm fine.\"\n\"Why? Oh, I get it. You're trying to escape. Am I getting in your way?\"\n\nThe hand holding the suitcase flinched. As he looked at me with an eerie smile, he looked exceedingly dangerous the more he stared. There was ice glistening behind his golden irises.\n\n\"You thought I wouldn't know,\" his large hand wrapped around mine and held the suitcase handle tightly, \"Just to avoid me and that bastard, you're trying to run away.\" His harsh words didn't match his aloof expression. \"It'll spell trouble, Yuni. If you disappear from my sight.\" The gentle and feeble, sickly prisoner suddenly had became an obsessive yandere himself.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",

However, it seemed like the author was one step ahead of the reader in this case. To the rage-fuelled message that Hee-ro had sent in response to the ridiculous ending, the author replied, \"Would you like to try?\" Then, Hee-ro woke up as a character in Adventure King.\n\nNot all character possessions end up being fortunate, however. The character that Hee-ro's soul had occupied was an extra in volume 1, chapter 1 whose sole purpose was to be used as a benchmark for the strength of the main character, \"Leo,\" then tossed aside. The message that appeared before this Hee-ro now said:\n\n[Take up space on the pages, secure yourself story time, and survive till the end of the story.]\n\nChances to reappear at 0%, and no abilites or skills! All he has is the knowledge of the whole plot of Adventure King...\n\n(Source: Naver Corporation, translated)",

Even if everyone in the Imperial Palace were wary of me, they didn't hate me yet.\n\n'Let's not be impudent, and be obedient.' I obstinately didn't need nor have the mindset of trying to be loved by the emperor. Although the male leads who were the concubines were giving me glances, I could just lie flat. Since it wasn't even a very difficult thing, I really did so. It was definitely like that, but\u2014\n\n\"Come to my bedchamber tonight. I'll read you a fairy tale!\"\n\"P-please don't cry. I'll give you this.\"\n\nJust why is everyone's attitude endlessly gentle? I couldn't understand, and it was baffling. '...I don't need it though?' I wasn't really a young kid lacking affection. And that gaze with which they looked at me as if I was the loveliest in the world was extremely uncomfortable. Just where would I use a fairy tale book that's full of jewels and silk, and the magic pearl which is the Imperial Family's heirloom? Since it's already been done, I just wish for everyone to get out of my palace.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",

    "synopsis": "Pearl is bad. She smokes, drinks, runs away from home, and has no qualms making her parents worry. Her mother and sister beg her to be a better student, sister, daughter; her beleaguered father expresses his concerns with his fists. Bad Friends is set in the 1990s in a South Korea torn between tradition and Western modernity and haunted by an air of generalized gloom. Cycles of abuse abound as the characters enact violence within their power structures: parents beat children, teachers beat students, older students beat younger students. But at each moment the duress verges on bleakness, Ancco pulls back with soft moments of friendship between Pearl and her best friend, Jeong-ae. What unfolds is a story of female friendship, a Ferrante-esque connection formed through youthful excess, malaise, and struggle that stays with the young women into adulthood.\n\nServed by a dry and precise line, Bad Friends viscerally captures the adolescent years of two young women who want and know they deserve something different, but, ultimately, are unable to follow through. In a culture where young women are at a systemic disadvantage, Ancco creates a testimonial to female friendship as a powerful tool for survival. Pearl forgets her worst adolescent memories, but she cannot ever shake the memory of her friendship with Jeong-ae during her most tumultuous years.\n\n(Source: Drawn & Quarterly)",

Lee Kang-To serves as a Japanese police in Korea and devotedly serves and respects Japan while seemingly betraying his origins. Meanwhile his brother is a loyal Korean patriot who was beat down so severely by the Japanese police that he became mentally unstable. In order to care for his brother (and others that he holds dearly), Kang-To needs power and money. How is going to acquire recognition from the Japanese, and obtain a more powerful position? Catch the legendary Gaksital. The Gaksital and Kang-To serve as perfect foils for each other; their ideals differ. While Kang-To believes that it's right for the strong to prey on the weak because the strong worked that much harder to achieve power, the Gaksital believes in equity among all people. And so the Kang-To (Justice) vs Gaksital (Justice). Cat-and-Mouse chase begins. As truths are revealed, friendship-family ties shatter, the people of Korea rebel, and tragedies unfold, hundreds of thousands of lives are lost. And Lee Kang-To changes from the Japanese's dog, to a tragic hero of Korea. This is a tragic story of love-hate, right-wrong, patriotism, betrayal and redemption.\n\n(Source: Sorrow)",
